# Facial Recognition

Facial recognition is an experimental demonstration of a popular computer vision service, [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com). The Clarifai API provides a service to identify faces in images, and this application demonstrates what Clarifai's algorithm sees visually, by outlining faces in photos.

Users can upload their photos and see what the AI sees, or try to break the AI by uploading photos with hard-to-recognize faces.

## Technologies Used

This is a client-driven app built with React, various browser APIs, and powered by the Clarifai API for facial recognition.
